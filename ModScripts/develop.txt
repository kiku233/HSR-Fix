TODO we need a json file to store the information to config
  and use it to pass the draw value
  Merge vb0 files,generate config file,use it to import into blender,modify and export
  Split the output ib and vb file seperatelly,and write draw number in config
  Generate a final .ini file used to load back to game.
TODO need to test with weapon export
    # TODO drawindexed cannot work perfectly! need to use draw xxx,0  xxx is calculated in GIMI's blender script.
    #  we now can make sure that this xxx value is comes from
    #  (the length of position file's bytes / the stride of position file)
    #  Even with the right draw number,the texcoord still cannot draw in the texcoord hash correctly,but GIMI can do this correctly.
    #  very strange,but now we can only use the IB to replace vb1 texcoord.
